## Sobre o projeto

This is my first website repository, with the intent to apply for internship positions.
I'm making this following MacLinz's video tutorial and using it as my model. Although that said, I've been putting my flavor at it, but the backbone is the same.

This project will be using HTML, SCSS, and vanilla Javascript for the Front.

I will be using the Google Cloud service Firebase to deploy :rocket:.

For the Contact Form, I had a recent experience using Elasticemail and SMTPjs making it free of cost and needless server. So I'll initialy keep with it, though I'm willign to make one with Firebase Functions and an Node.js API if one does exist.


## Tecnologias e Ferramentas

* HTML5
* Javascript
* SCSS
* Firebase (Hosting)
* EmailJS
* Fontawesome
